If you are sick and tired of having to write properties loading code for each
new project where properties files are used and if you'd prefer to have simple
annotations for this, then this project is what you are looking for.

This is a very lightweight alternative of Spring's cool org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value.
While Spring's idea is great, sometimes you just have the limitation of not being
allowed to use it in your project.

Check the USAGE file for examples of how to use the code.
